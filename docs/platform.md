# Jason Tanner — Cherokee County Platform

## Issues That Matter to Cherokee County
Cherokee County is growing quickly, and growth brings both opportunity and responsibility. As your State Representative, my role is to advocate for our communities at the state level, make sure state policies support smart local decision-making, and ensure Cherokee County has a strong voice in Atlanta. I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I believe in listening, learning, and working with people who understand these challenges firsthand.

### Managing Growth & Infrastructure
Growth should be intentional, not reactive. I will advocate for state policies and funding that help local governments plan ahead — ensuring roads, utilities, public safety, and schools keep pace with development. I will oppose state mandates that override local planning decisions without community input and support legislation that gives cities and counties the flexibility to grow responsibly.

### Transportation & Traffic
Traffic is one of the clearest signs that growth is outpacing planning, especially along I-575 and major corridors in Woodstock, Canton, and Holly Springs. I will work with the Georgia Department of Transportation and regional partners to push for congestion relief, safety improvements, and long-term planning that reflects how Cherokee County residents actually live and commute. State transportation decisions should be shaped by local realities, not just traffic models.

### Housing Affordability & Taxes
Rising housing costs and increasing property taxes are putting real pressure on families across Cherokee County. I support state policies that encourage a wider range of housing options, while protecting established neighborhoods.

I am also deeply concerned about statewide efforts to eliminate Georgia state taxes. While it may sound appealing, notice that there has been no transparency about what state services would be cut and what other taxes would be imposed. Certainly, critical services for our community would be eliminated and sales taxes would increase dramatically, both of which would disproportionately hurt middle class families and benefit the wealthy. The reality is that when state revenue disappears, the cost doesn’t — it gets shifted onto local property taxes, fees, and reduced public services. Homeowners, especially seniors and working families, would pay more, not less. State taxes fund schools, transportation, public safety, and healthcare access. When funding is cut, housing becomes less affordable, infrastructure falls behind, and communities struggle to maintain essential services. I will advocate for responsible, sustainable tax policies that keep Georgia competitive while protecting families and local communities.

### Strong Public Schools
Our public schools are one of Cherokee County’s greatest strengths, and as our community grows, the state must be a reliable partner in keeping them strong. That means fully and fairly funding public education, reducing overcrowding, and making sure classrooms have the resources they need to succeed. State education dollars should strengthen public schools, not be diverted away. I will fight for fair funding and listen closely to educators, parents, and administrators so state-level decisions reflect what’s actually happening in classrooms. Strong public schools are essential to strong communities, a competitive workforce, and a thriving local economy.

### Supporting Seniors & Affordable Care
Cherokee County is home to a growing senior population, many living on fixed incomes while facing rising property taxes, healthcare costs, and increasingly unaffordable long-term care. Too many families are forced into impossible choices when assisted living, memory care, or in-home health services become financially out of reach.

I will advocate for state policies that expand affordable in-home and community-based care, helping seniors age in place and reducing reliance on costly residential facilities. I will support strengthening the healthcare workforce, improving transparency and oversight in long-term care pricing, and protecting state programs that help seniors access care without being forced out of their homes or communities.

### Protecting Families Online & Social Media Reform
In my work with the Social Media Victims Law Center, I’ve seen firsthand how unchecked online platforms can harm individuals, families, and communities. From cyber harassment to the spread of dangerous misinformation, social media has real-world consequences that affect public safety, mental health, and civic engagement.

As your State Representative, I will advocate for commonsense reforms that hold platforms accountable, give victims clear avenues for redress, and improve safety for children and vulnerable adults. I will work with educators, parents, and law enforcement to ensure digital spaces are safer, and state policies reflect the values we uphold in our communities.

### Preserving Community Character
Woodstock, Canton, and Holly Springs are different — and state policy should respect that. I will support conservation and land protection programs that help preserve green space and rural areas, and oppose top-down policies that ignore the unique character of our communities.

### My Approach
I’m running to bring steady, practical leadership to the state level — leadership that listens first, works across party lines, and focuses on results instead of rhetoric. I may not have all the answers, but I am committed to asking the right questions, working with those who do, and making sure Cherokee County’s voice is heard clearly at the Capitol.

## Why I’m Running

I come from a family of farmers, factory workers, and truck drivers. I grew up watching people work hard, play by the rules, and still struggle. What I learned early on is that dignity doesn’t come from wealth or titles—it comes from showing up, taking responsibility, and taking care of one another.

I was raised in public schools, surrounded by people from different backgrounds, and supported by a community that believed kids deserved opportunity no matter their ZIP code or their parents’ income. I was shy growing up, but I learned over time—especially through leadership roles—that having a voice means using it to stand up for others, not just yourself.

Service has been the throughline of my life. I joined the Marines straight out of high school because I wasn’t ready to chart a career at eighteen, but I was ready to serve. The military taught me accountability, teamwork, and what it means when decisions have real consequences. Later, as a federal agent and digital forensic practitioner, I spent decades working in roles where the facts matter, responsibility matters, and cutting corners isn’t an option. I’ve worked with large institutions and seen firsthand what happens when power operates without transparency or accountability.

Today, I serve as the Director of Forensics for the Social Media Victims Law Center, a non-partisan organization that helps families who have been harmed by social media platforms. This work is deeply personal and often heartbreaking. I’ve sat with parents searching for answers after losing a child. Helping families find truth and accountability has reinforced something I’ve believed my entire life: systems should serve people—not the other way around.

I’m also a father and stepfather to four kids. Like many parents, I worry about the world they’re inheriting. This past year, I’ve felt increasingly frustrated and helpless watching our democracy strained, accountability disappear, and basic rights treated as expendable. I realized that standing on the sidelines and complaining wasn’t enough anymore. If I believe in service—and I do—then stepping forward was the only honest choice.

I’m running because I believe every community deserves real representation and real choices on the ballot. I believe in doing the right thing, even when it isn’t popular. I believe leadership means listening, being accountable, and remembering who you work for. And I believe that when representatives forget the people they serve, it’s not radical to demand better—it’s necessary.

This campaign isn’t about ideology or ambition. It’s about giving our community a voice, protecting the values that brought so many of us here, and proving that even from a small county district, integrity and common sense still matter.

## A Call to Action
Everything in my life has been guided by one simple belief: service above self.

I learned it from my family—people who worked hard, sacrificed quietly, and put others before themselves. I lived it through public education, military service, and a career built on accountability and responsibility. And I see its absence today in a political system that too often rewards ego, power, and loyalty to party over loyalty to the people.

I’m running because I believe our community deserves representation rooted in service, not self-interest. Leadership should be about listening, showing up, and doing the hard work even when no one is watching. It should be about accountability to the people who put their trust in you—not to donors, corporations, or political extremes.

If you believe:

- Public service should mean exactly that—service…
- Our democracy is strongest when everyone has a voice and real choices…
- We can protect our values, support our schools, and grow responsibly without losing who we are…

Then I’m asking you to stand with me.

This campaign is not about ambition or ideology. It’s about restoring a simple principle: that those who serve should put the needs of their community above their own. Even in a small county district, that principle matters—and it still has the power to create real change.

Join me. Vote. Volunteer. Speak up.

Let’s prove that SERVICE ABOVE SELF isn’t just a slogan, it also means ACTION ABOVE WORDS.
