# TannerForGA

Static campaign website for Tanner for Georgia State House District 20.

## Tech
- Plain HTML + JavaScript (no server-side components)
- Static hosting friendly (GitHub Pages / Netlify / S3)

## Getting started (later)
Once we add site files, you’ll be able to open `index.html` directly in a browser, or run a simple local static server.

## Notes
- Keep the repo static-only (no backend).
