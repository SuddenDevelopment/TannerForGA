            <p>
              Cherokee County is growing quickly, and growth brings both opportunity and responsibility. As your State Representative,
              my role is to advocate for our communities at the state level, make sure state policies support smart local decision-making,
              and ensure Cherokee County has a strong voice in Atlanta.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t claim to have all the answers, but I believe in listening, learning, and working with people who understand these
              challenges firsthand.

                <p>
                  Growth should be intentional, not reactive. I will advocate for state policies and funding that help local governments plan
                  ahead — ensuring roads, utilities, public safety, and schools keep pace with development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will oppose state mandates that override local planning decisions without community input and support legislation that gives
                  cities and counties the flexibility to grow responsibly.

                <h3>Transportation &amp; Traffic</h3>
                <p>
                  Traffic is one of the clearest signs that growth is outpacing planning, especially along I-575 and major corridors in
                  Woodstock, Canton, and Holly Springs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will work with the Georgia Department of Transportation and regional partners to push for congestion relief, safety
                  improvements, and long-term planning that reflects how Cherokee County residents actually live and commute. State
                  transportation decisions should be shaped by local realities, not just traffic models.

                <h3>Housing Affordability &amp; Taxes</h3>
                <p>
                  Rising housing costs and increasing property taxes are putting real pressure on families across Cherokee County. I support
                  state policies that encourage a wider range of housing options, while protecting established neighborhoods.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am also deeply concerned about statewide efforts to eliminate Georgia state taxes. While it may sound appealing, notice
                  that there has been no transparency about what state services would be cut and what other taxes would be imposed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will advocate for responsible, sustainable tax policies that keep Georgia competitive while protecting families and local
                  communities.

                <h3>Strong Public Schools</h3>
                <p>
                  Our public schools are one of Cherokee County’s greatest strengths, and as our community grows, the state must be a reliable
                  partner in keeping them strong.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That means fully and fairly funding public education, reducing overcrowding, and making sure classrooms have the resources
                  they need to succeed. State education dollars should strengthen public schools, not be diverted away.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I will fight for fair funding and listen closely to educators, parents, and administrators so state-level decisions reflect
                  what’s actually happening in classrooms.

                <p>
                  In my work with the Social Media Victims Law Center, I’ve seen firsthand how unchecked online platforms can harm
                  individuals, families, and communities. From cyber harassment to the spread of dangerous misinformation, social media has
                  real-world consequences that affect public safety, mental health, and civic engagement.

                <p>

                  avenues for redress, and improve safety for children and vulnerable adults.

          <div class="prose">
            <p>
              I come from a family of farmers, factory workers, and truck drivers. I grew up watching people work hard,
              play by the rules, and still struggle. What I learned early on is that dignity doesn’t come from wealth or titles—it
              comes from showing up, taking responsibility, and taking care of one another.
            </p>

            <p>
              Service has been the throughline of my life. I joined the Marines straight out of high school because I wasn’t ready to
              chart a career at eighteen, but I was ready to serve.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, I serve as the Director of Forensics for the Social Media Victims Law Center, a non-partisan organization that helps
              families who have been harmed by social media platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
              I’m running because I believe every community deserves real representation and real choices on the ballot. I believe in
              doing the right thing, even when it isn’t popular. I believe leadership means listening, being accountable, and remembering
              who you work for.
            </p>

            <p>
              This campaign isn’t about ideology or ambition. It’s about giving our community a voice, protecting the values that brought
              so many of us here, and proving that even from a small county district, integrity and common sense still matter.
